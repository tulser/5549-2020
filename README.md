# FRC Team 5549's 2019-2020 Robot Code 

This is the code for FRC Team 5549's robot 2020 Season: Infinite Recharge

# Deploying Code

1. Move to the folder with the code using `cd [directory name]`
2. Connect to the robot's WiFi
3. Deploy code to the robot using `py -3 robot.py deploy`. Add `--no-version-check` to the end you are deploying during the offseason.

Optional: Feel free to use the deploy scripts found [here](https://github.com/FRC5549Robotics/5549-Scripts).

# TODO

- Solicit the speed controller layout on the robot from build.
  - Need their types (Talon, Victor), numbers, purpose, and their corresponding motor locations.
- Solicit build for robot radius for rotations.
- Solicit build for drivetrain wheel circumference or wheel radius.
- Commit investment fraud.
